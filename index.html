   <h1> My Hungary </h1>
   <p>Most of you probably don't know where Hungary is. It's because Hungary is really small. I've met some people who were not kids and they never even heard of Hungary. If you want to know where Hungary is, how it looks like and what the culture is then just keep reading my article</p>
   <p>Hungary is in Central Europe. We have seven neighbouring countries: Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia. Seven Hungaries could fit in to Texas because Hungary is only slightly smaller than Indiana. Hungary is landlocked country which means that we don't have any seaside.</p>

<p> It is in the Central European timezone so we are 7 ours ahead of Texas. Right now the time here is 11:10 AM and in Hungary it is 6:10 PM. People in Hungary speak Hungarian. We are the only country that speaks this language. It is unlike any European languages. There are 54 letters in our alphabet.</p>

<p> We have school 5 days same as here and holidays too. Something that I haven't seen here is taht in most schools in Hungary after every class we have a 15 minute  break. We can eat, talk, go outide and even be on our phones in that break. Ususally school starts in September.</p>

<p>In Hungary there are a lot of sports. People don't really play American Football. There is a sport called handball which I used to play.Handball is not only in Hungary it is famous in Europe. The ball that we use for playing is relatively small but bigger than a tennisball!It is small ball because we need to thorw with one hand and the professionals catch with one hand. Here is how it looks like: </p>

      <p> Both girls and boys can play handball. You have to be agressive to play because when the other team's people stand in front of you and they are kind of creating a wall you got to break through. There is a lot more about handball but this is enough for now!
